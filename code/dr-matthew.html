<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>My friend Matthew is looking to land a remote job in the United States. I wanted to use AI to help him in his job search.</p>
<p>This document walks through how I would approach the problem with access to the AI tools as of May 2023.</p>
</section>
<section id="strategy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strategy">Strategy</h2>
<p>I will make use of ChatGPT from OpenAI to do the business strategy section, and Bing’s AI in creative mode for the sourcing of companies, as it has access to the internet.</p>
<section id="honing-in-on-a-sector" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="honing-in-on-a-sector">Honing in on a sector</h3>
<p>I first begin by asking ChatGPT for some sectors that Matthew could work in given his skills:</p>
<p><b>Role: you are an expert in remote recruitment and business strategy.</b></p><b>
<p>My friend Matthew is looking to land a remote job in the United States. I want you to help direct his job search and suggest strategies to find a job. I will give you his profile, and then I want you to suggest 8 areas of work that you think he could be suited to.</p>
<p>Matthew has a bachelor’s degree in commerce from the University of Cape Town, in South Africa, where he studied business, economics as well as healthcare economics. Subsequently, he studied for an MBChB (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery) degree at the University of Cape Town medical school. After graduating, he worked for two years in a regional hospital in KwaDukuza, north of Durban, and for one year at Mitchell’s Plain Community Health Centre. He is interested in Orthopedic surgery, sports medicine, and treating mental health with ketamine.</p>
<p>The things that he values in the job which he hopes to land are: - work-life balance and a set number of hours per week, preferably hours when other people are also working (as opposed to night shifts) - good remuneration - possibilities for career progression towards a life when he can earn income from things other than his own labour.</p>
</b><p><b>What kinds of jobs do you think he would be well suited for?</b></p>
<p>ChatGPT: - Given Matthew’s background in commerce, healthcare economics, and medicine, as well as his specific interests and values, I suggest the following eight areas of work that could be well-suited for him:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Healthcare consulting: Matthew can work as a remote healthcare consultant, helping hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare organizations to optimize their operations, reduce costs, and improve patient outcomes.</li>
<li>Medical sales representative: Matthew can work remotely as a medical sales representative for pharmaceutical or medical device companies, leveraging his healthcare knowledge to promote their products to healthcare providers.</li>
<li>Health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) analyst: Matthew can use his background in healthcare economics to help organizations evaluate the cost-effectiveness of medical treatments, interventions, and healthcare policies.</li>
<li>Remote medical coding: Matthew can work remotely as a medical coder, translating medical diagnoses, procedures, and other information into standardized codes for billing and data analysis purposes.</li>
<li>Online medical education and training: Matthew can develop and deliver remote medical education and training programs for healthcare professionals, medical students, and organizations, focusing on orthopedic surgery, sports medicine, or mental health treatment with ketamine.</li>
<li>Clinical research: Matthew can work remotely as a clinical research associate or coordinator, managing and overseeing clinical trials for pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, or research institutions.</li>
<li>Health informatics: With his medical background, Matthew can work in health informatics, focusing on the analysis, management, and optimization of health information and data for improved patient care and decision-making.</li>
<li>Remote utilization review: Matthew can work as a remote utilization review specialist, evaluating the medical necessity, appropriateness, and efficiency of healthcare services, procedures, and facilities.</li>
</ol>
<p>In pursuing any of these remote job opportunities, Matthew should leverage his medical and commerce background, as well as his specific interests in orthopedic surgery, sports medicine, and mental health treatment with ketamine. This will help him find a suitable position that aligns with his values and provides opportunities for career progression.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="more-about-health-economics-and-outcomes-research-heor-analysts">More about Health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) analysts</h3>
<p>Next I ask: <b>Great, can you tell me about some roles within the Health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) analyst space? Be specific about the skills needed and the work involved.</b></p>
<p>ChatGPT: -Health Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR) analysts play a crucial role in the healthcare industry, evaluating the cost-effectiveness, safety, and real-world outcomes of medical treatments, interventions, and healthcare policies. Some specific roles within the HEOR analyst space include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Health Economist: Health economists analyze healthcare data to assess the value of various healthcare interventions, including cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, and cost-benefit analyses. They use economic modeling techniques, such as decision-analytic models, budget impact models, and Markov models, to forecast the potential impact of healthcare interventions on patient outcomes and healthcare costs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Skills needed: Knowledge of healthcare economics, economic modeling techniques, data analysis, statistical software (e.g., R, STATA, SAS), and strong communication skills.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Outcomes Researcher: Outcomes researchers focus on studying the real-world effectiveness and safety of healthcare interventions. They design, conduct, and analyze observational studies, patient registries, and retrospective database analyses to measure patient-reported outcomes, quality of life, and clinical endpoints.</li>
</ol>
<p>Skills needed: Study design, data collection and analysis, knowledge of patient-reported outcomes measures, experience with healthcare databases (e.g., claims data, electronic health records), and proficiency in statistical software.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Market Access Analyst: Market access analysts help pharmaceutical and medical device companies develop strategies to ensure their products are available and accessible to patients. They research and analyze pricing, reimbursement, and health technology assessment (HTA) policies across different markets, and support the development of value dossiers and economic models to demonstrate the value of the product to payers and healthcare providers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Skills needed: Understanding of pricing and reimbursement policies, HTA processes, stakeholder engagement, value proposition development, and strong analytical and communication skills.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Health Policy Analyst: Health policy analysts study healthcare policies and regulations to assess their impact on patient outcomes, healthcare costs, and access to care. They provide recommendations for policymakers and healthcare organizations based on their research findings and help develop evidence-based policies that improve the healthcare system.</li>
</ol>
<p>Skills needed: Knowledge of healthcare policies and regulations, research methods, data analysis, policy evaluation, and strong written and verbal communication skills.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>HEOR Project Manager: HEOR project managers oversee the planning, execution, and monitoring of HEOR projects, ensuring that they are completed on time, within budget, and meet the desired objectives. They coordinate the work of multidisciplinary teams, manage project timelines, and communicate progress and results to stakeholders.</li>
</ol>
<p>Skills needed: Project management, team coordination, budgeting, timeline management, problem-solving, and effective communication.</p>
<p>Overall, professionals in the HEOR space should have a strong background in healthcare, economics, statistics, and research methods. They should also possess excellent analytical, problem-solving, and communication skills, as they often need to translate complex data into actionable insights for decision-makers in the healthcare industry.</p>
