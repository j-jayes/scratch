## Purpose

Regex test for removing the spaces between the numbers. The regex `"(\\d) (\\d)"` looks for a number (`\\d`) followed by a space (` `) and another number (`\\d`), and replaces it with the first number (`\\1`) followed by the second number (`\\2`).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

tbl <- tribble(
  ~input, ~desired_output,
  "1 234",   1234,
  # Here we have a leading space
  " 456",    456,
  "78 910",  78910,
  "12 345 678", 12345678
)

tbl %>% 
  mutate(output = str_replace_all(input, "(\\d) (\\d)", "\\1\\2"),
         output = str_squish(output),
         output = parse_number(output)) %>% 
  mutate(correct = identical(desired_output, output))

```
